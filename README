NAME
    Jifty::Plugin::Authentication::Facebook - Facebook authentication plugin
    for Jifty

  DESCRIPTION
    Provides standalone Facebook authentication for your Jifty application.
    It adds the columns "facebook_name", "facebook_uid", "facebook_session",
    and "facebook_session_expires" to your User model.

SYNOPSIS
    In your jifty config.yml under the "framework" section:

        Plugins:
            - Authentication::Facebook:
                api_key: xxx
                secret: xxx

    You may set any options which the "new" method of WWW::Facebook::API
    understands.

    In your User model, you'll need to include the line

        use Jifty::Plugin::Authentication::Facebook::Mixin::Model::User;

    after your schema definition (which may be empty). You may also wish to
    include

        sub _brief_description { 'facebook_name' }

    To use the user's Facebook name as their description.

    See Jifty::Plugin::Authentication::Facebook::View for the provided
    templates and Jifty::Plugin::Authentication::Facebook::Dispatcher for
    the URLs handled.
